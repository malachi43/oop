# This project shows how OOP can be used to achieve encapsulation,inheritance,abstraction and polymorphism

### ABSTRACTION

###### The file `index.js` has an abstract class called `Animal` which other base classes like `Cat`, `Butterfly` and `Frog` extends.

###### NOTE: The abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated but only extended. Trying to instantiate the class will throw an error.

### POLYMORPHISM

To show what polymorphism actually, the abstract class, ```Animal``` provides methods that can only be specifically implemented by instances or objects of class that extends it.

### INHERITANCE

To show what inheritance actually entails the subclass can access the properties and methods of the super class or base class like it was defined in the subclass itself.

### ENCAPSULATION

This simply means hiding implementation details from external classes and object. This ensures that only useful methods and properties are available to external classes or objects as the case maybe.
